## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at [DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/web/ueber-uns/standorte-kontakt/darmstadt) and [TU Darmstadt](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/index.de.jsp), 
where I joined the [Data and AI Systems Lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/systems/systems_tuda/dai/index.en.jsp) in late 2020. Earlier, I worked as scientific assistant at [DHBW Mannheim](https://www.mannheim.dhbw.de).
I have a Master's degree in [Intelligent Systems](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/technische-fakultaet/studium/master/MA-Intelligente-Systeme/)
from [Bielefeld University](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de) and a Bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from [TH OWL](https://www.th-owl.de).


## Research Interests
My research lies in the intersection of centralized and distributed data systems and machine learning.
- **Data Systems:** Distributed Stream Processing Systems (Storm, Flink), Database Systems, Cost Estimation, Performance Prediction
- **Machine Learning:** Zero-Shot learning, Graph Neural Networks
